Within a directory (where you want to use git),
you'll have, what you should consider to be,
different areas:

1.  The working directory (holding your files)
2.  The repository, holding all your git commits
    over time.
3.  The staging area, the intermediate area used
    to stage interactions between the working
    directory and the repository.


THE STAGING AREA

For example, say I have three files in my
working directory:

cake.txt
frosting.txt
chili.txt

I can move, say, two of those files to my staging
area before I chose to then add the snapshot of the
work I've done as a commit to my repository.
When I want to make that commit, that will be
taken into the repository as one commit on those two
files.

HOW TO DO THIS IN THE TERMINAL

So my working directory is already up and running, let's call
it recipes.  My terminal command line will look like this:

ksmith (master #) recipes $

(don't worry about the master bit, this is something
the computer adds itself).  To add files to the staging area
you need to input:

        git add

e.g.
ksmith (master #) recipes $ git add

and you'll include the files you want to add to the staging area,
e.g.

ksmith (master #) recipes $ git add cake.txt
ksmith (master #) recipes $ git add frosting.txt

If you run git status now, git will tell you  that these
files have been added to the staging area.
