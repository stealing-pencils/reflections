Certain 'background files' that are hidden from the
user are necessities, but considered to be unimportant
for the user.  These files often begin with a fullstop
and cannot be searched for in the normal method you would
when looking for a file.  In fact, to locate them, you
will need to use the terminal and rather than asking it
to list files by typing just:

ls

You will have to input:

ls -a

This will list all the files in the folder, including
the hidden ones, such as git files.

HOW TO CREATE A GIT REPOSITORY FROM SCRATCH:

You can either create a new directory or add a git repository
to a directory that already exists.

1.  After choosing or creating a directory in the terminal, make sure
    you're sitting within that directory, e.g.  ksmith $ cd version-control

2.  use git init to create a new repository e.g.

    ksmith version-control $  git init

    If you run $ ls -a after this action, you will see that a git repository
    has been created (displayed as .git)


TIP - You can run: git status to be shown which files have been changed since
the last commit.
