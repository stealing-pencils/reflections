git checkout is a method of going back to a particular commit (or
version of your work and restoring it).

HOW TO:

If you want to open your html in a browser...
1. Navigate to the file using 'Finder'

2. If you saved your repository in the Home dir and are having
   trouble finding it just press Cmd + Shift + H

3. Find the appropriate dir and then file, but right click to
   'open the file in Chrome'

TO USE GIT CHECKOUT

1. In Terminal, make sure you're in the correct dir with the correct
   file.

2. type:
      git checkout
   and paste the appropriate git log code next to 'checkout'
   then press return.

   When you go back to the file that you have used git checkout on,
   you should find that this commit is the version that is currently
   available, i.e. if I used a particular commit id code for git checkout
   in the terminal and then went back to to the html file, the computer
   would load the version of that file that was saved when that commit
   was entered.

   Does that make sense? Not sure.

GIT LOG

So if I've selected an earlier commit and I now request the git log in
the terminal, the terminal will tell me that the commit I have just
selected, is the latest change to the file.

There is a way to go and review the more recent commits not displayed here,
but that comes in a later lesson.
