Git has a command that allows
you to clone an entire repository
(the separate files that are related
and each of their historical commits).

To use this git clone method, in the
terminal cd to the dir you would like
to copy the repository to, (so in
this case the dir will be 'version-control')
and then type the command git clone followed
by the url of the repository you want to copy.
E.g.

KateSmith version-control $ git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroiuds.git
